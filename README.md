The OrangeHRM System is a web-based system that manages employee photos. Employees can add or change their photos and Human Resources can add or change everyone's photos. The system produces lists of images by different selection criteria. Its photos will be used by many other systems in the company. The photos are stored in a configurable file structure and a file system points to the photo location. This release only includes employee photos, name and address, and social security information, not any other information planned for later.
